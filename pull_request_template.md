> You can upload videos to GitHub by dragging, copy&pasting or via the attachment ðŸ“Ž menu.
> To save some storage on GitHub you can use the following command to compress and/or speed up the video
> ```
> ffmpeg -i input.mov -vcodec libx264 -crf 35 -vf "setpts=0.25*PTS" output.mp4
> ```
> - The `-crf 35` sets the [Constant Rate Factor][crf], which is a scale from 0-51 where 0 is loseless compression and 51 is the worst possible.
> - The `-vf "setpts=0.25*PTS"` is a [filter][pts] to speed/slow up/down the video, in this case `0.25*PTS` will speed up the video 4x and `2*PTS` would slow it down by half.
